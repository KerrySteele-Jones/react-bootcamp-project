# Kerry Steele-Jones â€” React Portfolio

A responsive React portfolio showcasing nine projects (8 weekly challenges + final project). Includes a filterable/searchable gallery, clean component architecture, and deployment on Render.

## âœ¨ Features
- Multi-page React app (Home, Projects, [+ About/Contact])
- Interactive project gallery (search, tag filters, sort)
- Fully responsive layout (mobile â†’ desktop)
- Accessible keyboard navigation & focus states
- Deployed on Render

## Planned Feature: Direct Project Pages (case studies)

Current behaviour:
On the homepage, each item in Selected Projects links to the live demo. This is intentional for now so nothing 404s.

Planned behaviour:
Each project will get its own internal page (a short write-up/case study). When those pages exist, the homepage list will link to them first, and only fall back to the live demo if a page isnâ€™t ready.
